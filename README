ngx_openresty is a full-fledged web application server by bundling the standard nginx core,
lots of 3rd-party nginx modules, as well as most of their external dependencies.

This bundle is maintained by us, agentzh and chaoslawful, and sponsored by
Taobao.com, Alibaba Group.

Because most of the nginx modules are developed by the bundle maintainers, it can ensure
that all these modules are played well together.

The bundled software components are copyrighted by the respective copyright holders.

To build ngx_openresty, you need a working perl (at least perl 5.6.x)
in your PATH environment, and then follow the following steps:

1. download the latest ngx_openresty tarball can be downloaded from

     http://agentzh.org/misc/nginx/ngx_openresty-0.8.54.0.tar.gz

   we will eventually migrate to the openresty.org domain.

2. and then enter the ngx_openresty-0.8.54.0/ directory,
   and type the following command to configure:

        ./configure

   by default, --prefix=/usr/local/openresty is assumed. You can
   specify various options, as in

        ./configure --prefix=/opt/openresty \
            --without-http_drizzle_module \
            --with-http_iconv_module \
            --with-http_postgres_module

    try ./configure --help to see more options.

3. build everything locally

        make

4. install ngx_openresty into the target directory that you specified by
   the --prefix option in Step 2.

        make install
