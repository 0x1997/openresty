ngx_openresty is a full-fledged web application server by bundling the standard nginx core,
lots of 3rd-party nginx modules, as well as most of their external dependencies.

This bundle is maintained by us, agentzh and chaoslawful, and sponsored by
Taobao.com, Alibaba Group.

Because most of the nginx modules are developed by the bundle maintainers, it can ensure
that all these modules are played well together.

The bundled software components are copyrighted by the respective copyright holders.

A quick note to Debian and Ubuntu users:
    You're recommended to install the following packages using apt-get before
    installing this bundle:

        apt-get install libreadline-dev libpcre3-dev libssl-dev perl

A quick note to Fedora/RedHat users:
    You're recommended to install the following packages using yum before
    installing this bundle:

        yum install readline-devel pcre-devel openssl-devel

A quick note to Mac OS X (Darwin) users:
    You're recommended to install prerequisites PCRE using some package
    management tool, like Homebrew:

        brew install pcre

    Alternatively you can install PCRE from source all by yourself :)

To build ngx_openresty, you need a working perl (perl 5.6.0 or better)
in your PATH environment, and then follow the following steps:

1. download the latest ngx_openresty tarball can be downloaded from

     http://agentzh.org/misc/nginx/ngx_openresty-0.8.54.5.tar.gz

   we will eventually migrate to the openresty.org domain.

2. and then enter the ngx_openresty-0.8.54.5/ directory,
   and type the following command to configure:

        ./configure

   by default, --prefix=/usr/local/openresty is assumed. You can
   specify various options, as in

        ./configure --prefix=/opt/openresty \
            --with-luajit \
            --without-http_drizzle_module \
            --with-http_iconv_module \
            --with-http_postgres_module

    try ./configure --help to see more options.

    For Solaris, it's common to install libraries like OpenSSL to /lib,
    so when it complaints about OpenSSL and you have indeed
    already installed it, specify the --with-ld-opt='-L/lib' option.

    At least on some Debian systems, when --with-luajit is specified,
    it is required to specify the option --with-ld-opt="-ldl" as well.

    Errors in running the ./configure script can be found in this file:

        build/nginx-0.8.54/objs/autoconf.err

3. build everything locally

        make

   Note that, "make -jN" may not work at least for FreeBSD's "bsdmake"; use
   gmake (i.e., GNU make) instead or avoid using the jobserver feature with
   your make.

4. install ngx_openresty into the target directory that you specified by
   the --prefix option in Step 2.

        make install

Then you can start your server this way:

    /usr/local/openresty/nginx/sbin/nginx -p /path/to/your/server/root \
            -c /path/to/your/nginx.conf

assuming you're using the default "prefix", i.e., /usr/local/openresty, in Step 2.

For bundle maintainers:

    The bundle's source is at the following git repository:

        https://github.com/agentzh/ngx_openresty

    To reproduce the bundle tarball, just do

        make

    at the top of the bundle source tree.
