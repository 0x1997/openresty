ngx_openresty is full-fledged web application server by bundling the standard nginx core,
lots of 3rd-party nginx modules, as well as most of their external dependencies.

This bundle is maintained by us, agentzh and chaoslawful, and sponsored by
Taobao.com, Alibaba Group.

Because most of the nginx modules are developed by the bundle maintainers, it can ensure
that all these modules are played well together.

The bundled software components are copyrighted by the respective copyright holders.
